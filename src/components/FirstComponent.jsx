const FirstComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>New Component here!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
    </div>
  )
} // to create a valid React Component, we should create a function (name it as the file, starting with capital letter)

export default FirstComponent // do NOT forget to export the function! In this way we are going to be able to use it in other files
